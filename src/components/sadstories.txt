Sad Story 1:

One day I was walking along happy and carefree and all my teeth fell out.  You would think that that super glue would be better at it's job.  Now I haven't any teeth and can only gnaw at my food.  Sad that it is I love drinking my vodka and coke.  But without my teeth I can crunch into my favorite snacks.

Please donate to my sad and sorry toothless life.  Or I'll sneak into your homes at night and drool on you.


Sad Story 2:

This is the story of a little cat who doesnâ€™t like to brush her teeth. Both teeth start out happy, but as decay sets in, we see the damage the sugar bugs do to her teeth.  Shouldn't drink those V energy drinks and go to sleep without brushing your teeth.  


Sad Story 3:

Damn my teeth are falling out and rotten to the core.  You'd think some rich person would at least donate to fix them.  Gosh, selfish buggars.  Fix My Teeth.

Sad Story 4:

I sold all my teeth to Donald Trump and he'll not give them back to me.  That asshat can't even give me some plastic teeth to replace them.  Probably has gone bankrupt again that stupid shit.
